# Gemini 3.0 Coding Testing

This project serves as a testing ground for the coding capabilities of Gemini 3.0. It contains various HTML5 experiments and prototypes generated to evaluate the model's performance in creating interactive web applications.

The repository is structured to host multiple isolated test cases, allowing for focused evaluation of specific coding tasks, from game logic to visual design implementation.

## Current Test Cases

- **FPS Game**: A browser-based first-person shooter implementation testing 3D rendering and game loop logic.
- **Retro Futurism**: A visual design test exploring specific aesthetic requirements and CSS implementation.
- **Figma to HTML**: A fidelity test converting design mockups into pixel-perfect HTML/CSS.
- **Scaling Law Demo**: An interactive visualization demonstrating scaling laws in AI models.
- **ServerlessLLM Demo**: A 3D visualization of a locality-enhanced inference system for LLMs, featuring an academic black-and-white aesthetic.
- **Spacegram**: A mimic ability test recreating an existing website design.
- **JoJo Maker**: A creative tool for generating JoJo's Bizarre Adventure style character cards.
- **Stellar Shuttle**: An immersive Interstellar-inspired space simulation featuring a Ranger spacecraft, black hole visualization, and dynamic audio synthesis.
- **Retro Typewritter Test:** A retro feeling typewritter type speed test.
- **Pro Tennis 3D**: A high-fidelity 3D tennis simulation using Three.js, featuring realistic physics, dynamic lighting, and post-processing effects.
- **ROS2 Demo**: An interactive demonstration of ROS2 concepts and robotics visualization.
